# STATIC and DYNAMIC âš¡
> ** What are the differences between STATIC mode and DYNAMIC mode ?**

#### STATIC : 
This mode start the server from the template server you've created. The server cannot be started multiple times while the server is on.

#### DYNAMIC : 
This mode copy the server in a temporary folder and run from it. The server can be launched multiple time. When the server is shutting down, the copied server will be deleted. It's useful for minigames/lobbies servers.

:::caution
Dynamic mode is currently in development and can be changed due to optimization.
To optimize the network, please don't have big sized folder in your template for the Dynamic mode
